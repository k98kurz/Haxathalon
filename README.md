Haxathalon Project Stuff
=====

Current projects are related to games and the like.
Prototype/example code is most likely to be mostly JS/HTML.

##Projects/to-do
```
1. 2D damage calculation algorithm (DEPRECATED)
  a) Made for a simple multiplayer space battle game.
  b) Can be used in 3D games if 3D vectors are not needed.
  c) Current scope is only JS/HTML for demonstration purposes--will likely port to Java and C++ for real games. (REDACTED)
  d) Turn-based AI simulation (REDACTED)
2. 2D damage calculation algorithm -- updated
  a) Made for more complex multiplayer space battle game.
  b) Implements simple ship/hullsectionmap concept classes
  c) Implements simple latency-based targetting, moving, and damaging "game" engine
  d) Random AI simulation
  e) Understandable visual representation
3. 2D gravity/force simulator
  a) 2D force vector subtraction algorithms will be useful for more accurate/complex 2D damage calculation algorithms
  b) May be useful for games involving dynamic orbital mechanics
4. 2D top-down crew/squad controls
  a) Group movements
  b) Individual selection and actions
  c) Area-of-effect example mechanics
5. Actual multiplayer 2D space battle strategy game for Java
  a) 2D damage calculations
  b) Simulated 3rd spacial dimension for projectile impact timing
  c) Either RTS or turn-based network operations
  d) Possible Android port
